# Setting up 
This section details how to install and set up your environment for development.
### (1)
First, download and install:
  - Unity Hub
  - Unity 2021.3.x (LTS)
      - 
  - Visual Studio (2019 or 2022, doesn't matter, newer is nicer)
      - When Running the Visual Studio Installer, make sure "Game Development With Unity" is selected. This will make your coding experience a lot nicer.
      - NOT Visual Studio Code.
### (2)
  - Clone this repository
