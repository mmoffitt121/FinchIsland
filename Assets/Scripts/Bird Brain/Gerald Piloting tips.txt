Gerald Flight Training Guide 101

1) Make sure you put Gerald in the scene, we need him
2) Attach a camera to gerald, make sure the rotation is ay x=0, y=180, z = 0. For some reason gerald is backwards (Thanks Matt)
3) Attach a rigidbody to gerald. This is so he can have some sort of resistance while flying. Mass = 1, Drag = 2, Angular Drag = .5
4) On the rigidbody, take off gravity and make sure the collision detection is discrete
5) Attatch the Main Brain Frame script. Give hime like 5000 steps or something (Max steps)
6) Should automatically have all the forces and speeds but just in case:
	Move force = 2
	Pitch/yaw speed = 100
7) Attach the camera you created in step 2 to the script under Gerald POV
8) Add a behavior parameter, Make sure the behavior name is bird.
9) Vector Observation set to 10, Continuous Actions to 5, and discrete branches to 0
10) Set Inference decive to CPU and Behavior type to Heuristics only.
11) Make sure in the Script that testing is checked off, or else it wont work.

Good luck future pilots :)
